= RMU API Attack

REST API for attack management in the RMU system using MongoDB and Hexagonal Architecture.

== Description

This API exposes endpoints to manage attack information, including creating, querying, updating, and deleting attacks in the RMU (Rolemaster Unified) system. The API uses MongoDB for persistent data storage and follows Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) principles for better separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

== Prerequisites

* Python 3.11+
* MongoDB (local or remote instance)
* pip

== Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then execute:

Install dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

Run the application:

[source,bash]
----
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
----

== Configuration

The application can be configured using environment variables:

* `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB connection string (default: `mongodb://localhost:27017`)
* `MONGO_DATABASE`: Database name (default: `rmu-attacks`)
* `DEBUG`: Enable debug mode (default: `false`)
* `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (default: `INFO`)

== Endpoints


* `GET /v1/attacks/{attackId}` - Search attack by Id
* `GET /v1/attacks/` - Search attacks with RSQL
* `POST /v1/attacks/` - Create a new attack
* `PATCH /v1/attacks/{attackId}` - Update attack modifiers
* `DELETE /v1/attacks/{attackId}` - Delete an attack
* `POST /v1/attacks/{attackId}/roll` - Update attack roll
* `POST /v1/attacks/{attackUd}/apply` - Applies the result of the attack to the tactical game system

* `GET /` - Root endpoint with API information
* `GET /health` - Health check endpoint with database connectivity status

== Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access the interactive documentation at:

* Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
* ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

It is divided into the following blocks:

* *modifiers*: values calculated in the tactical module used for the creation and update of the attack.
* *roll*: information on dice rolls applicable to attack or critical rolls.
* *results*: result of the attack, whether it is an attack with no effect, a damage, a set of critical hits, or a failure.
